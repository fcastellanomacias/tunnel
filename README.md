## The tunnel number of all 11 and 12 crossing alternating knots.

* [knotinfo_data_complete.csv](./knotinfo_data_complete.csv): database of knots and knot invariants, downloaded from [KnotInfo](https://www.indiana.edu/~knotinfo/).
* [tunnel_code.py](./tunnel_code.py): code to compute tunnel numbers and find Montesinos knots (implementable in [SnapPy](https://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/SnapPy/)).
* [tunnel_data.csv](./tunnel_data.csv): database of knots with 11 and 12 crossings, containing some of their tunnel numbers and the fraction decomposition of Montesinos knots.
